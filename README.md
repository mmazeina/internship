# Internship

The task for this internship is to test the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an environment for creating minimalistic scientific project websites.  

The advantages of using GitHub for creating websites:
* Many pre-developed templates are available and a new website can be quickly created with minimal effort;
* Everything can be done online on GitHub without installing any web development software.

The results are available at [https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io](https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io/). The corresponding GitHub repository where we worked on the website is at [https://github.com/when-you-are-in-a-new-place/when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io](https://github.com/when-you-are-in-a-new-place/when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io).

### Step 1: Creating a free GitHub account

On [github.com](https://github.com/), we used the green "Sign for GitHub" button for creating an account, and then we followed the onscreen instructions.  

### Step 2: Creating an organisation

To create a website in GitHub Pages, we need to have an account with the same name as the future website name. For that, we created an organisation, which is like an account but you can access it easily via your own account, without the need for a separate login and password.

Create an organisation following tips in the [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) article on GitHub Docs.  

The new organisation is named "when-you-are-in-a-new-place".  

### Step 3: Finding and choosing a website template

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provide several themes https://pages.github.com/themes/ and even more themes are available, for example, at [https://jekyllthemes.io/free](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).  

We chose the Minimal template available at [https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) with a preview at [https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/).  

### Step 4: Forking the template

At https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal click the Fork icon in the top-right corner and then choose where to place it. We used the organisation we created earlier (see **Step 2**).  

Then, via the "Settings" tab, we changed the name of the repository from "minimal" to "when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io". It allows creating a website because the name of the organisation and the name of the website are the same.  

Now the new website is ready and available at [https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io/](https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io/).  

### Step 5. Editing website title - `_config.yml`

In `_config.yml` we can change the website title and website description so when you open it you see the website title in the browser tab.

### Step 6: Editing pages in Markdown - `index.md`

Next, I started modifying the "index.md" file while experimenting and learning how the Markdown language works (.md stands for markdown).  

For example, `**text**` will create **text** in bold font.  

To create a link, we need to use this format: `[text](link)`, for example `[github.com](https://github.com/)` for [github.com](https://github.com/).

### Step 7: Editing layout in HTML - `_layouts/default.html`

Minimal changes were introduced in `_layouts/default.html` where we worked in HTML: removig some text.


### Step 8. Adding a favicon

Favicon is the very small image we see in the browser tab when opening a webpage.  

In PowerPoint, we can create an image in PNG with a transparent background so it can be transformed into a favicon. For that, we used shapes and text in PowerPoint, then grouped everything by selecting all and Right-click > Group > Group.  

To export an image in PNG format: Right-click > Save as picture...  

From this image, we now can create a favicon. We used an online favicon generator at [https://realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).  

After downloading the favicon package, we took the favicon.ico file and put it in the root of the website directory (drag and drop).

### Step 9. Collaborative editing in Google Docs

The report was prepared in Google Docs and copied in the README file.
