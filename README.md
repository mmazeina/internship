# Internship

The task for this internship is to test the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an environment for creating minimalistic scientific project websites. The advantage of using GitHub for creating websites:
* Many pre-developed templates are available and a new website can be quickly created with minimal effort;
* Everything can be done online on GitHub without installing any web development software.

### Step 1: Creating a free GitHub account

On [github.com](https://github.com/), we used the green "Sign for GitHub" button for creating an account and followed onscreen instructions.  

### Step 2: Creating organisation

Create an organisation using the [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) article on GitHub Docs.  

The new organisation is named "when-you-are-in-a-new-place".  

### Step 3: Finding and choosing a website template

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provide several themes https://pages.github.com/themes/ and even more themes are available, for example, at [https://jekyllthemes.io/free](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).  

We chose the Minimal template available at [https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) with a preview at [https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/).  

### Step 4: Forking the template

At https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal click the Fork icon in the top-right corner and then choose where to place it. We used the organisation we created earlier (see **Step 2**).  

Then, via the "Settings" tab, we changed the name of the repository from "minimal" to "when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io". It allows creating a website because the name of the organisation and the name of the website are the same.  

Now the new website is ready and available at [https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io/](https://when-you-are-in-a-new-place.github.io/).  

### Step 5: Editing the website pages

Next, I started modifying the "index.md" file while experimenting and learning how the Markdown language works (.md stands for markdown).
