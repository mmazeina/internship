# Internship

The task for this internship is to test the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an environment for creating minimalistic scientific project websites. The advantage of using GitHub for creating websites:
* Many pre-developed templates are available and a new website can be quickly created with minimal effort;
* Everything can be done online on GitHub without installing any web development software.

### Step 1: Creating a free GitHub account

On [github.com](https://github.com/), we used the green "Sign for GitHub" button for creating an account and followed onscreen instructions.

### Step 2: Creating organisation

We created an organisation using the [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) article on GitHub Docs.

### Step 3: Finding and choosing a website template

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provide several themes https://pages.github.com/themes/ and even more themes are available, for example, at [https://jekyllthemes.io/free](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).
